After using this product for two days I'm sharing my feedback.Pros:1. Good looking (that's it)2. Performance is quite goodCons:1. The company claims that this Phone will fully charge in 19 mins but in reality it's taking around 50 mins to fully charge the phone. The battery will drain too fast even though the phone is on standby and you will get heating issues as well.2. Got a scratch on screen after rubbing the phone on the bedsheet. So not sure what the use of victus glass is.3. InREAD MORE

More features  more cost with 120w fast charging edge screenwaterproof  back with redmi dialer interesting onePrice is good and best no comparison of price fully loaded with feature and best designThank you redmi for this best feature phoneWorth it  for money
Me chosen black varient. It hasn't vegan leather they're not mentioned in advertisement so unknowingly chosen black. There hasn't policies to change colour.1. Camera - 3/5 not giving wow performance2. Processor - 4/5 performance is superb3. Battery - 2/5 Draining too fast. But 19mins for full charge that's good part.4. Display - 5/5 Awesome6. IP 68 - 5/5 AwesomeI felt heating issues too. Performance wise phone is good except battery draining.
Everything is awesome in this price go for it without doubt
Good phone but litte bit over priced
Product is excellent happy to receive
Excellent 
Excellent camera night vision superb justify 200 megapixel  in 10x zoom it's feel like microscope for close pic100% better then realme narzo 200 megapixel cameraDesign performance excellentJust need to check waterproofed Or not but dont have gutz bcoz it's only one day old 
This phone is amazing I like the overall performanceplease go for itignore the negative reviews
When using the camera for a few minutes it's getting over heating and just talking on video call also getting over the heating problem I just feel like it's getting melted when using this phone It's a really horrible and fearful experience.
This products is very bad battery is poor and camera bad etc same price best in realme 11 pro super
Camera is AwesomePerformance is very ExilentI love this product is very to good
Mobile phone screen overheating unable to touch screen don't waste ur money
Don't buy this mobile battery drain very fast  average camera 36k waste for this mobile
Overall products are average 200 megapixel camera is not working 64 megapixel is much better than this. The battery is drained in just 3-4 Hrs of use and needs to be charged 2-3 times a day. Products is not justifying it's cost in this segment.
Very bad camera quality
I have bought a new mobile but there seems to be a battery problem because the mobile is not able to be fully charged even within 40 minutes. It took 42 minutes to fully charge it. battery dying is quickly. Display is good much clear and sound is also good.
Mind blowing performance Camera Superb Battery Charging Osm
Charging was worst takes almost 50 mins plus Don't seek like 120 watts charger
Camera quality ossomeLooking nice but price is high
It is not a good device because of unnecessary pre-installed application and bloatware. It still runs on Android 13 instead of Android 14. The Mediatek dimensity processor is used in this device instead of the snapdragon processor which is not good.
Got the Phone on 16thJan  1st Day review.1.Yes the review you see by is correctBattery drains faster maybe because of brightness.2.Note Camera are not upto the mark I thought this will change. But this phone also disappointed me.3.full Fast charge happened in 29 min not 19min.4.Display is extreamly good.5.Look good and stylish6.overprized
Good but camera is not that satisfying. Performance is good.
Please improve camera colour or such type thing
Best Mobile
Mobile performance is good camera is not that much effective Apart from camera everything is awesome
It deserves a 5 star because it is a value for money phone and has some of the best feature in this range compared to poco x6 pro one plus 11r iqoo z7 pro. Was hesitant to buy poco x6 has a better performance but this phone has better camera than oppo and performance is already top notch.
Very nice redmi note 13 pro plusFast charging mobile
Usefull moble
in 30+k1. Worst user interface2. Camera like 10mp3. Dispaly looting in the name of curve. Nothing special. Minimal curve just to loot us.4. Battery 100-80% 1 hour. 80-0 1 hour5. Heatet in sunlight even in winter6. Feels heavy in hand not thini have used Note 7 Note 10they were better comparison to this DABBA. Your money but dont buy this.
Worst processor
Paisa waste product
Camara performance is not good  i use this phone 20days
Nice 
Very good product I like redmi note 13 pro+ it's very smooth with new features Thanks flipkart
Awaome product and excellent price. Some has writen a review about battery draining issue but it is actually because of high refresh rate and light theme. Adjust some settings of the phone and you will get enough battery back up. Charging speed is very fast. It also shows alert if you will charge at 120 watt it might heat up a little. But I noticed that once the charging is done at an extraordinary speed the phone does not looks heated at all. Overall very good product at this process range.READ MORE
Nice
Good
Almost all fineBattery draining issue and heating issue is there
Very nice mobile!!
Unbeatable smart phone.
Good mobileGood chargingGood desply
Nice but ok
Amazing phone 
Waste redmi product battery drains much faster  at least for 6 hours it's not keeping the charge worst thing
As using this device for 1 week quite OK for heavy users. its 200 MP camera is not upto the Mark.as compared to my OLD note 10T pro 5G its display rate is low i.e. 120 HZs where my old device had rate of 144Hzdevice gets heat during charging may be cause of 120 W turbo charge.gaming Experience is good but snapdragon rocks always in gaming expectations.overall good experience till now
IP 68 No best work but device is the best
5g network problem
Worst Mobile
I bought this phone cause it was the one with all the features like ip68 good cam good resolution avg performanceBattery wasn't upto the markit drains faster than I expected it doesn't drain fast gives a decent battery life but I was expecting a better battery life with 5000mah also camera isn't also that good as promised slight shaking creates blur or shakky objectsbut on the positive side if u want a phone for avg daily usage it's a good phone
Ya I like it.Premium design. Super displayI am happy with this phone
Coming from a previous Samsung user:The product what you get at the same price in Samsung is offering way less than this.I feel this is good value for money phone but battery is drains very fast ofcourse you can charge 100 in less than 30 min stylish look good camera and nice performance.I don't see any issue with camera ofcourse am comparing with Samsung 
Mobile is not turning on it's automatically turned of after setting up device it happened one day it's worked after that it's automatically turned off now it's battery also not working
Awesome Product and Good Camera Quality.
Very good performance and camera is wonderful very good experience of redmi
WORST  TOOO WROST CAMER QUALITY. NO DETAILING  DISPLAY GOOD SOUND GOOD BUT CAMERA FULLY DISAPPOINTED
So much poor in under 35k. Camera are soo bad and not perform very well. Everyone is perfect in this mobile only camera are soo worst
I hate product
Mobile is getting too heat and the camera is not up to the mark pro+ is not good and it's my opinion as the 13pro+ user
Worst product charging taken 1hour to battery full
Everything looks good except battery backup. Battery is draining too fast. Need to fix this
Good
Stunning phonefast charginggreat camera awesome portraitanimation effect
Camera is mid. 10x maximum zoom for this price is not acceptable.There is some noticable heating while gaming and charging probably due to leather back. And ofcourse battery drains a lot.Fingerprint reader is also slow and sometimes does not work.I hope they release HyperOS for 13 series soon. And I hope there are more software optimizations in te future.
Awesome loved it!!!
Best phone redmi note 13 pro plus
The phone is not worth for the price. Bad quality camera.
